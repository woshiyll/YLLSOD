# YLLSOD Dataset Analysis
The dataset consists of a total of 3263 pairs of images, all with a resolution of 384Ã—384. 
As shown in the following figure, the overall distribution of the dataset is depicted by the dual-layered pie chart on the left side. 
The inner layer of the ring represents the proportions of each sub-dataset in the total dataset. 
Specifically, RGBD-385, RGBT-621, RGB-252, VDT-766, VI-789, and LL-450 account for 24%, 14%, 12%, 19%, 8%, and 23% of the total data, respectively. 
The outer layer of the ring represents the proportions of data used for training and testing within each sub-dataset in relation to the total dataset.
On the right side of the following figure, data samples from each sub-dataset are showcased. 
The first and third rows depict low-light RGB images, while the second and fourth rows display the corresponding ground truth annotations.
